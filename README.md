## CargoJumper

CargoJumper is a senior AI/ML capstone project that explores how machine learning–informed workflows can support port logistics decisions such as container selection, loading, unloading, and balance checks.

This repository contains the **frontend application** used to simulate user workflows and visualize decision-making steps driven by data and predictive models.

## Project context
This project was developed as part of an **AI/ML senior capstone** focused on improving efficiency and decision support in port logistics.

The broader system explored:
- Using data and predictive modeling to inform cargo movement decisions
- Translating model outputs into understandable user workflows
- Evaluating how AI-assisted tools could reduce congestion and operational friction

This frontend emphasizes **clarity, usability, and flow**, making complex logistics tasks easier to reason about.
